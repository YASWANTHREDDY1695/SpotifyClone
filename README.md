---

## 📦 Installation (Local Setup with XAMPP)

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Move it to XAMPP

bash
Copy
Edit
mv your-repo/ /xampp/htdocs/your-repo/
Import the SQL file

Open phpMyAdmin

Create a database music_app

Import music_app.sql if provided (or manually create users/songs table)

Set Up Spotify API

Go to Spotify Developer Dashboard

Create an app and get Client ID & Client Secret

Add them to php/spotify_token.php

php
Copy
Edit
$client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID";
$client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET";
Run XAMPP and go to http://localhost/your-repo/index.php



🧑‍💻 Developer Notes
Songs must be placed in the /songs/ folder.

Cover images should be named/linked appropriately via cover_url.

Spotify API is used only to fetch metadata, not for actual music streaming.

This is a hobby/demo project. Not for commercial use.

### ✅ Final Tips

- Rename your PHP files inside `/php/` folder as above for cleanliness.
- Don’t commit `spotify_token.php` to GitHub. Put a dummy file there or `.env` based method.
- Want help exporting your MySQL DB as `.sql` and making a sample data dump? I can help you prep that too!

Let me know if you'd like the `README.md` and `.gitignore` files exported for you now—or if you'd like a zipped GitHub-ready version of your project.
